#these will be possible code bases pasted in this thread to work off of for a basic simulation.

Thanassis is too complicated but the simulation window is a complex version of what I am shooting for.

Next Step: Building python window that can display a circle as an object.

Then: Create a particle class.

I ended up hard coding the orbital patterns of our solar system because gravitational constant was too large to create within python based on my current knowledge.
