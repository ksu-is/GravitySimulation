#these will be possible code bases pasted in this thread to work off of for a basic simulation.

Thanassis is too complicated but the simulation window is a complex version of what I am shooting for.

Next Step: Building python window that can display a circle as an object.

Then: Create a particle class.

I ended up hard coding the orbital patterns of our solar system because gravitational constant was too large to create within python based on my current knowledge.

codebase.py is to show my failed gravitational expiriment, however, code.py is a sample hardcoded version of our solar system.
